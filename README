The Makefile contains the switches need to compile raytrace.
Also see the source file ray.f

First run raytrace with an input pile set up to output
step by step positions of the particles tracked.
e.g.
> raytrace <pair.idt >output

run getrays.pl to create files showing the tracks that
can be read into a plotting program.
This also creates a file with the coordinate transfer
parameters into the world system.
e.g.
>getrays.pl <output

run getsummary.pl to extract the focal plane location

> get summary.pl <output

run raytrace with a 46 ray bundle (see manual) to
get the transfer matix elements
e.g.
> raytrace <pair-46.idt >output-46

The code calres.pl will read the matrix elements from output-46
and attempt to estimate the resolutions using parameters
defined within the code.
e.g.
> calres.pl
